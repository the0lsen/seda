# Summary
Brown dwarfs and extrasolar gas giant planets exhibit complex, dynamic atmospheres that undergo diverse physical and chemical processes, including disequilibrium chemistry, cloud formation, auroral activity, and variability, which depend on fundamental properties and observational factors such as temperature, age, metallicity, rotation period, and  viewing geometry [e.g., @Marley_Robinson2015;@Biller2017;@Vos_etal2017]. 
These atmospheres also exhibit a rich diversity of chemical species, including water, methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and silicates [e.g., @Kirkpatrick2005;@Cushing_etal2006]. 
Studying the chemistry and physics of these atmospheres provides insights not only into the atmospheric processes that govern their behavior, but also into the formation and evolution of these objects [e.g, @Luhman2012].
In the long term, understanding these atmospheric conditions is essential for characterizing potential habitable worlds with next-generation observatories and for contextualizing the uniqueness of our own.

We introduce `SEDA` (Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer), a versatile open-source Python package for forward modeling of observations of ultracool objects, such as brown dwarfs, directly imaged exoplanets, and low-mass stars. 
This workflow employs a Bayesian framework based on pre-computed, self-consistent atmospheric models.
`SEDA` also incorporates a broad set of empirical techniques and auxiliary tools for spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, as described in [Functionality](#functionality).
Overall, `SEDA` enables the inference and analysis of atmospheric composition, cloud properties, and fundamental physical parameters of ultracool objects from observational data.

# Statement of Need
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of extrasolar atmospheres by providing high-quality observations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. 
These data will synergize with observations from next-generation facilities such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and 30-m class telescopes (e.g., the Extremely Large Telescope, ELT, and the Thirty Meter Telescope, TMT). 
Furthermore, a large volume of multiwavelength data is already available from wide-field photometric surveys [e.g., SDSS, @York_etal2000; and Pan-STARRS, @Chambers_etal2016], all-sky photometric surveys [e.g., Gaia, @GaiaCollaboration2020; 2MASS, @Skrutskie_etal2006; and WISE, @Cutri_etal2013], targeted spectroscopic programs [e.g., SpeX Prism Library, @Burgasser2014; MOCAdb, @Gagne_etal2025], and both large [e.g., LAMOST, @Luo_etal2015; and APOGEE, @SDSS-DR17] and all-sky [SPHEREx, @Dore_etal2014] spectroscopic surveys.

To fully exploit these extensive datasets, it is necessary to develop techniques and software capable of managing heterogeneous, multiwavelength observations (see [State of the Field](#state_of_the_field)).
`SEDA` contributes to this need by providing a framework for the analysis and forward modeling of photometric and spectroscopic multiwavelength data either separately or jointly, 
using spectra of varying resolution and/or overlapping wavelength coverage, 
as well as photometry from a broad range of filter systems compiled by the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service[^1]. 
In addition to its modeling capabilities, the package incorporates a growing set of empirical techniques commonly used in the literature, offering a unified and flexible framework for both model-based and empirical SED analysis (see [Functionality](#functionality)).

# State of the Field {#state_of_the_field}
Several software packages enable forward modeling of ultracool dwarf data, including \texttt{VOSA} [@Bayo_etal2008], \texttt{Starfish} [@Czekala_etal2015], \texttt{SEDkit} [@Filippazzo_etal2015], \texttt{SPLAT} [@Burgasser2017], \texttt{species} [@Stolker_etal2020], \texttt{ForMoSA} [@Petrus_etal2023], \texttt{PICASO} [@Ahrer_etal2023], and \texttt{ucdmcmc} [@Burgasser_etal2026]. 
Except for \texttt{VOSA}, these packages primarily focus on spectroscopic data, with limited ability to incorporate photometry in the model fitting.
To our knowledge, only \texttt{species} can forward model SEDs constructed from photometry alone or combined with spectra, but its empirical analysis capabilities are relatively limited. 
In contrast, \texttt{SPLAT} provides more empirical analysis tools similar to those in \texttt{SEDA}, but it is restricted to modeling spectroscopic observations. 
\texttt{SEDA} complements these packages by supporting the modeling of spectrophotometric SEDs and offering extensive empirical analysis techniques, facilitating the study of brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets.

# Functionality {#functionality}
![Overview of the SEDA workflow, illustrating key components such as forward modeling, empirical analysis, and additional useful tools.\label{fig:workflow}](figures/SEDA_workflow_2026.png){width=1.00\textwidth}

\autoref{fig:workflow} illustrates the core functionality and key tools of `SEDA`.

`SEDA` forward modeling employs two complementary approaches:
a Bayesian framework with nested sampling to construct posterior distributions and 
a chi-square minimization method to find the best-fitting models (see [Mathematics](#mathematics)). 
The code supports both widely used and state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids, namely 
Lacy (2026, in preparation), 
SAND [@Alvarado_etal2024],
Sonora Diamondback [@Morley_etal2024], 
Sonora Elf Owl [@Mukherjee_etal2024], 
@Lacy_Burrows2023, 
Sonora Cholla [@Karalidi_etal2021], 
Sonora Bobcat [@Marley_etal2021], 
ATMO 2020 [@Phillips_etal2020], 
BT-Settl [@Allard_etal2012], and 
@Saumon_Marley2008.
Collectively, these models span a broad range of atmospheric and physical conditions, 
from cloud-free to cloudy atmospheres; 
equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemistry; 
metallicities from very low ($-2.4$ dex) to super-solar ($+0.5$ dex);
temperatures from the coldest brown dwarfs through hot and temperate exoplanets to low-mass stars ($\sim$ 300--4200 K);
and surface gravities ($\log g$=3.0--5.5) appropriate for both young and old ultracool objects.
`SEDA` also allows users to easily incorporate additional atmospheric model grids, as well as evolutionary models.
Fitting these atmospheric model grids to observational data, the code infers chemical and physical parameters defined as free parameters in the grids, 
along with additional quantities such as bolometric luminosity and radius, when the distance is known (see [Mathematics](#mathematics)). Additional fundamental parameters, including mass, age, surface gravity, and effective temperature, can be derived using evolutionary models from the model families described above, as well as BHAC15 [@Baraffe_etal2015].


Empirical analyses of SEDs include measurements of the strengths of key spectral features produced by gas and grain species using literature-defined or user-defined spectral indices, i.e., flux ratios that quantify the depth of specific spectral signatures. 
These indices are applied to mid-infrared features [e.g., @Cushing_etal2006; @Suarez_Metchev2022; @Suarez_Metchev2023], as well as to near-infrared diagnostics designed to identify potential variable objects [e.g., @Ashraf_etal2022; @Oliveros-Gomez_etal2022; @Oliveros-Gomez_etal2024]. 
Additional empirical analyses include the estimation of fundamental parameters such as bolometric luminosity, radius, and inclination, and the application of published relationships between fundamental parameters, including temperature-spectral type, luminosity-spectral type, and inclination-cloudiness-color trends [e.g., @Filippazzo_etal2015; @Vos_etal2017; @Kirkpatrick_etal2021; @Suarez_etal2023].

In addition, `SEDA` provides several auxiliary tools that can be used independently, including:
$(i)$ the calculation of synthetic photometry from spectra for any filter available through SVO,
$(ii)$ a model interpolator that generates synthetic spectra for any parameter combinations within the grid coverage of available atmospheric models, 
$(iii)$ a model examiner that enables inspection of atmospheric model properties, such as basic and free parameters, parameter coverage, resolving power, and spectral resolution, and 
$(iv)$ access to 113 Spitzer IRS mid-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs from @Suarez_Metchev2022, together with associated target properties, observing logs, and measured spectral indices, and 

# Mathematics {#mathematics}
For model fitting, as described in [Functionality](#functionality), the code adopts two approaches:

**1. Chi-square Minimization**

The code uses the following weighted reduced chi-square ($\chi_r^2$) definition: 

\begin{equation}
\chi^2_r = \frac{1}{N-n_p}\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \left(\frac{F_{\text{obs},i}-\alpha F_{\text{mod},i}}{\sigma_i}\right)^2
\label{eq:chi2_r}
\end{equation}

Here, $N$ is the number of fitted data points, $n_p$ is the number of free model parameters (so $N-n_p$ are the degrees of freedom), $w_i$ is the weight assigned to each data point to balance the relative contributions of datasets with different numbers of data points, $F_{\text{obs},i}$ and $\sigma_i$ are the observed fluxes and their uncertainties, $F_{\text{mod},i}$ are the model fluxes, and $\alpha$ is an unknown geometric dilution factor equal to $(R/d)^2$, where $R$ is the object radius and $d$ is its distance. 

The code provides several options for assigning the weights $w_i$, which are designed to compensate for differences in the number of data points among datasets and to ensure no dataset has a negligible contribution to the fit (e.g., photometric data versus spectra, or low-resolution versus high-resolution spectra). These options include:
$(i)$ assigning each dataset a weight equal to the inverse of its total number of data points, so that all datasets contribute the same, even if they have very different numbers of points; and
$(ii)$ weighting spectroscopic data points by their wavelength resolution (i.e., wavelength step) and photometric data points by the filter effective width, such that broader filters or low-resolution spectra receive larger weights than high-resolution spectra.

To determine the value of $\alpha$ that minimizes $\chi_r^2$, the code can either use the non-linear least-squares minimization python package \texttt{LMFIT} [@Newville2014] or compute the analytic solution obtained by setting $\tfrac{\partial \chi^2_r}{\partial \alpha}=0$, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}w_i\dfrac{F_{\text{obs},i}F_{\text{mod},i}}{\sigma_i^2}} {\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}w_i\dfrac{F_{\text{mod},i}^2}{\sigma_i^2}}
\label{eq:alpha_chi2_r}
\end{equation}

**2. Nested Sampling**

For Bayesian model fitting, the code adopts the weighted Gaussian log-likelihood ($\ln \mathcal{L}$):

\begin{equation}
\ln \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ w_i \frac{(F_{\text{obs},i} - \alpha F_{\text{mod},i})^2}{\sigma_i^2} + \ln \left( 2 \pi \, \sigma_i^2 \right) \right]
\label{eq:log-likehood}
\end{equation}

with all parameters defined as in \autoref{eq:chi2_r}. 
The code wraps the model interpolator with the dynamic nested sampling package \texttt{DYNESTY} [@Speagle_2020] to construct posteriors. 
During sampling, each generated synthetic spectrum is scaled using either 
$(R/d)^2$ if distance is known, 
or the factor that maximizes $\ln \mathcal{L}$, which is the same that minimizes $\chi_r^2$ (\autoref{eq:alpha_chi2_r}).

The scaling factor $\alpha$ is used to derive the radius from the equation above, independently of evolutionary models, provided that the distance is known. 
The observed data are complemented with the best-fitting model to construct a full hybrid SED, which is then integrated to determine the bolometric luminosity, if the distance is available. 
The radius and bolometric luminosity are used to estimate the effective temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law and can also be interpolated within evolutionary models to derive additional parameters, including mass, surface gravity, and age. 
Rotation-axis inclination can be inferred from $v\sin i$, rotation period, and radius using Monte Carlo propagation [@Vos_etal2017].

# Software Design
`SEDA` v1.0 accompanies this publication and represents a stable, well-tested release following multiple pre-releases used for development and community feedback.
The software is designed for flexible analysis of SEDs, centered on forward modeling and complemented by empirical analysis tools (see [Functionality](#functionality) and [Mathematics](#mathematics)).
The code includes automated tests to verify core functionality and has been successfully tested with Python 3.9 or later (latest tested: Python 3.14) on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

# Research Impact
The foundation of `SEDA` was introduced in @Suarez_etal2021a, which implemented only a chi-square minimization approach. 
In this work, we substantially expand upon that initial framework and release a significantly enhanced version of the software to the community.
`SEDA` has already been used in at least 14 publications (including published, submitted, or in preparation works) [e.g., @Suarez_etal2025;@Kiman_etal2026;@Rothermich_etal2026;@LHeureux_etal2026;@Lam_etal2026].

# Future Developments
Among several planned additions that will further increase the functionality of the code, future releases will 
$(i)$ enable measurements of projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) and radial velocity (RV) by incorporating rotational broadening and Doppler shifting into atmospheric model spectra, and 
$(ii)$ implement cross-correlation analyses to identify molecular species in medium- to high-resolution spectroscopic observations [e.g., @Petit_dit_de_la_Roche_etal2018].

We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community to help improve `SEDA` in future releases.
